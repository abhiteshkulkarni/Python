Python History and Versions:
Python laid its foundation in the late 1980s.
The implementation of Python was started in December 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at CWI in Netherland.
In February 1991, Guido Van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.
In 1994, Python 1.0 was released with new features like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.
Python 2.0 added new features such as list comprehensions, garbage collection systems.
On December 3, 2008, Python 3.0 (also called "Py3K") was released. It was designed to rectify the fundamental flaw of the language.

Why the Name Python?
There is a fact behind choosing the name Python. Guido van Rossum was reading the script of a popular BBC comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus". It was late on-air 1970s.

Van Rossum wanted to select a name which unique, sort, and little-bit mysterious. So he decided to select naming Python after the "Monty Python's Flying Circus" for their newly created programming language.

The comedy series was creative and well random. It talks about everything. Thus it is slow and unpredictable, which made it very interesting.

Python is also versatile and widely used in every technical field, such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, Mobile Application, Desktop Application, Scientific Calculation, etc.

Python is a high-level language, which means it is easy to learn and use. It is also possible to create your own language and integrate it into your application without worrying about the language specific features that will be available to you when interacting with Python.

Module- It is a file that contains code written by somebody else which can be imported 
and used in our programs.

pip: It is a package manager that used to install module on your system.

variables: It is a name given to a memory location in a programs 

Strings: It is a data type in python. It is a sequence of character that enclosed in quotes. Strings are immutiable which means that you cannot change them by running functions.
